Whether it\u2019s a weak password, a click on a phishing link, or a publicly-shared document, human errors are the biggest contributors to today\u2019s most devastating breaches. That\u2019s why traditional awareness training\u2014generic, episodic, and disconnected from actual risk\u2014has failed to reduce human-driven threats.\n\nWe created Fable Security to change that. This **Starter Human Risk RFP** is designed to help you evaluate human risk management platforms with an eye toward actually shaping behavior rather than checking boxes. These requirements are organized around five essential capabilities for any enterprise looking to reduce human risk. These are the **uber-requirements**\u2014foundational pillars that differentiate legacy programs from modern, outcomes-driven solutions.\n\n[Download RFP](https://fablesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Starter-RFP-for-modern-human-risk-management.zip)\n\nBlog\n\n##### Get fresh insights every week.\n\nEmail\n\nSubscribe\n\nRESOURCES\n\n## Related resources\n\nExplore guides, insights, and tools to strengthen your human defenses.\n\n[See more](https://fablesecurity.com/resources/)\n\n![](https://fablesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/strongest-link-blog-1350-x-699v14-1024x529.png)\n\nBlog\n\n##### Transform employees from targets to your first line of defense\n\nCheck out our launch from stealth with $31 million in funding and how we\u2019re building the modern human risk platform\u2014that shapes behavior directly.\n\n[Read more](https://fablesecurity.com/transform-employees-to-first-line-of-defense/)\n\n![](https://fablesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/hr-meet-match-blog-1350-x-707-1024x529.png)\n\nSolution brief\n\n##### Human risk,   meet your match\n\nWe reimagined human risk management with the best of Al, and it's simply delightful.

A firehose of threat research. A proving ground for technical prowess. A dazzling buffet of lateral malware movement, threat modeling, incident response, cloud architecture, and enough jargon to short-circuit a SIEM. It\u2019s brilliant, intense, and unapologetically deep-in-the-weeds. But also: it\u2019s a lot. Especially in the fluorescent hum of Vegas.\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re bringing something different: Fable is the modern human risk platform that shapes human behavior. It\u2019s simple and scalable and does three critically important things: synthesizes complex employee data to help you understand risk; pinpoints the most problematic behaviors; and deploys highly-relevant interventions to people automatically, in real time, right where they work. But our big promise? It\u2019s likely to be the thing you\u2019ll see at Black Hat that gives you the biggest bang for your buck, delivering real ROI, quickly, and in a way that\u2019ll delight your people.\n\nSo if you need a breather between packet captures and purple teaming, come find us. We\u2019ll show you how to reduce human risk at scale\u2014without the complexity tax.

They design, manufacture, and install solar panels for both residential and commercial use. \n\n**Internal Champion:**\n\nName: Emily Watson\nJob Title: Head of Training and Development\nDepartment: Human Resources\nProfessional Background: Emily has over 15 years of experience in HR, with a focus on training and development. She started her career as a Training Coordinator at a tech company, where she quickly climbed the ranks due to her innovative approach to learning and development. Emily joined Solarity Industries 5 years ago. \n\nEmily's goal is to ensure that Solarity's employees are equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to excel in their roles. Her main pain points include the inability to track training progress in real time and the lack of engagement in current training modules. She is motivated to adopt and expand the use of Fable's software across the organization to improve knowledge retention, increase learner engagement, and allow for real-time progress tracking.\n\nSolarity Industries has already purchased Fable's interactive training platform for their HR department. They use the platform to train new hires on company policies and procedures. However, they are not utilizing the software's full potential, especially the custom training content creation tools and the analytics dashboard.\n\nThe next step for Solarity Industries would be to implement Fable's software across all departments, not just HR. They could also benefit from Fable's content creation tools to create engaging and immersive training modules tailored to each department's needs. Additionally, they should start using the analytics dashboard to track learner progress and training effectiveness in real time. This would address Emily's pain points and help her achieve her goal of improving training outcomes at Solarity Industries.",
