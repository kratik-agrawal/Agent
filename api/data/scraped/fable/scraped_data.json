Whether it\u2019s a weak password, a click on a phishing link, or a publicly-shared document, human errors are the biggest contributors to today\u2019s most devastating breaches. That\u2019s why traditional awareness training\u2014generic, episodic, and disconnected from actual risk\u2014has failed to reduce human-driven threats.\n\nWe created Fable Security to change that. This **Starter Human Risk RFP** is designed to help you evaluate human risk management platforms with an eye toward actually shaping behavior rather than checking boxes. These requirements are organized around five essential capabilities for any enterprise looking to reduce human risk. These are the **uber-requirements**\u2014foundational pillars that differentiate legacy programs from modern, outcomes-driven solutions.\n\n[Download RFP](https://fablesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Starter-RFP-for-modern-human-risk-management.zip)\n\nBlog\n\n##### Get fresh insights every week.\n\nEmail\n\nSubscribe\n\nRESOURCES\n\n## Related resources\n\nExplore guides, insights, and tools to strengthen your human defenses.\n\n[See more](https://fablesecurity.com/resources/)\n\n![](https://fablesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/strongest-link-blog-1350-x-699v14-1024x529.png)\n\nBlog\n\n##### Transform employees from targets to your first line of defense\n\nCheck out our launch from stealth with $31 million in funding and how we\u2019re building the modern human risk platform\u2014that shapes behavior directly.\n\n[Read more](https://fablesecurity.com/transform-employees-to-first-line-of-defense/)\n\n![](https://fablesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/hr-meet-match-blog-1350-x-707-1024x529.png)\n\nSolution brief\n\n##### Human risk,   meet your match\n\nWe reimagined human risk management with the best of Al, and it's simply delightful.
