DataStream specializes in transforming raw data into actionable insights for businesses across various sectors, including healthcare, finance, and retail. They employ around 500 people and are known for their robust data analysis and predictive modeling.\n\nInternal Champion: The internal champion is Emily Turner, the Director of Data Science at DataStream. Emily has a Ph.D. in Computer Science, a background in machine learning, and has been with DataStream for over five years. Her main goal is to enhance their data analytics capabilities, and she has been struggling with the high costs and complexity of integrating advanced AI models into their existing systems. Emily is motivated to bring OpenAI's models into their operations, believing this can significantly improve their data analysis and predictive modeling capabilities.\n\nDataStream has already purchased access to OpenAI's GPT-4 for natural language processing tasks. They use it to help analyze text data and generate predictive models. However, Emily feels they are not maximizing the use of OpenAI's technology in their operations. She sees potential in integrating OpenAI's Codex for AI-assisted code generation and DALL\u00b7E for AI-generated images. These additions could potentially enhance their data analysis capabilities, improve the efficiency of their coding processes, and provide additional value to their clients.",
