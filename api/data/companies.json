        "content": "Customer Account: Our customer, Advanced Health Solutions, is a rapidly growing healthcare technology company located in Austin, Texas. With a team of over 1,000 employees, they specialize in developing software for electronic health records and telemedicine services. They're a perfect fit for Salesforce as they require a comprehensive system to manage their expanding client base and sales operations.\n\nInternal Champion: Our champion at Advanced Health Solutions is Melissa Hughes, the Director of Sales Operations. Melissa has over 15 years of experience in sales and operations management in the tech industry. Her main goal is to streamline sales processes and improve the productivity of her sales team. Her pain point is the lack of a centralized system to manage and analyze customer interactions, which leads to inefficiencies and missed opportunities. She is motivated to adopt Salesforce because she believes it can provide the necessary tools to optimize their sales process.\n\nCurrent Use and Expansion Opportunity: Advanced Health Solutions have already purchased Salesforce's basic Sales Cloud package. They are currently using it for contact management, opportunity management, and sales forecasting. However, as the company grows, they are finding it increasingly difficult to manage the volume of customer data and interactions. What's missing from their setup is Salesforce's AI-powered tool, Einstein Analytics. This tool could provide Melissa's team with predictive insights and recommendations, helping them to identify key trends and make data-driven decisions. In addition, they could benefit from Pardot, Salesforce's B2B marketing automation tool, to better align their sales and marketing efforts. This represents a significant expansion opportunity for Salesforce.",

        "content": "Customer Account: The fake customer account is for a company called \"WindTech Energy Solutions\", a prominent player in the renewable energy sector. WindTech is a mid-sized company with around 500 employees, specializing in wind turbine manufacturing and wind farm operations. They stand out in the market for their commitment to innovative technologies and sustainable practices. \n\nInternal Champion: The internal champion in WindTech is Katherine Collins, the Director of Strategic Partnerships and Innovation. Katherine has a decade of experience in the energy sector, with a strong background in business development and strategic planning. Her main goal is to enhance WindTech's competitive edge through strategic partnerships and innovative solutions. She is currently facing challenges in managing communication and collaboration with multiple partners, which is critical for her role. Katherine sees Unify's Go-to-Market solutions as a potential remedy for these pain points.\n\nWindTech has already purchased Unify\u2019s basic Go-to-Market package, which they are using to streamline their communication with their strategic partners. Katherine has found this to be very effective in improving their collaboration efficiency. \n\nHowever, given the expanding size and complexity of WindTech's operations, they are starting to outgrow the capabilities of the basic package. Katherine has expressed interest in the advanced features of Unify's premium package, such as advanced analytics and forecasting, which could provide crucial insights into their market strategies. This reveals an expansion opportunity for Unify, where they could upsell their premium Go-to-Market package to WindTech, helping Katherine and her team to further optimize their strategic partnerships and innovation efforts.",

He has over 15 years of experience in corporate security and is a strong advocate for leveraging technology to enhance security operations. His main goals are to reduce security breaches, increase efficiency, and maintain compliance with regulatory standards. His current pain points involve high costs and inefficiencies in manually monitoring numerous video surveillance feeds, along with the challenge of quickly extracting actionable insights from large volumes of video data.\n\nQuantum Logistics has already purchased a small number of Spot AI's AI-powered security cameras and is using them in a few of their warehouses. They are impressed with the efficiency and accuracy of the AI threat detection and the reduction in false alarms. \n\nHowever, they have not yet fully integrated the system with their existing security infrastructure. They could benefit from expanding the use of Spot AI's cameras to all their locations and leveraging the cloud-based video storage and analytics to manage and analyze video data more efficiently. \n\nExpansion Opportunity: The opportunity for Spot AI lies in demonstrating the scalability and integration capabilities of their solution to Quantum Logistics. By showing how their product can seamlessly blend with the existing security setup and scale across all locations, Spot AI can position themselves as a comprehensive, technology-driven solution for Quantum Logistics' security challenges. Further, by showcasing their advanced analytics capabilities, they can help Quantum Logistics extract more value from their video data, turning it into actionable insights for improved security operations.",

Whether it\u2019s a weak password, a click on a phishing link, or a publicly-shared document, human errors are the biggest contributors to today\u2019s most devastating breaches. That\u2019s why traditional awareness training\u2014generic, episodic, and disconnected from actual risk\u2014has failed to reduce human-driven threats.\n\nWe created Fable Security to change that. This **Starter Human Risk RFP** is designed to help you evaluate human risk management platforms with an eye toward actually shaping behavior rather than checking boxes. These requirements are organized around five essential capabilities for any enterprise looking to reduce human risk. These are the **uber-requirements**\u2014foundational pillars that differentiate legacy programs from modern, outcomes-driven solutions.\n\n[Download RFP](https://fablesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Starter-RFP-for-modern-human-risk-management.zip)\n\nBlog\n\n##### Get fresh insights every week.\n\nEmail\n\nSubscribe\n\nRESOURCES\n\n## Related resources\n\nExplore guides, insights, and tools to strengthen your human defenses.\n\n[See more](https://fablesecurity.com/resources/)\n\n![](https://fablesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/strongest-link-blog-1350-x-699v14-1024x529.png)\n\nBlog\n\n##### Transform employees from targets to your first line of defense\n\nCheck out our launch from stealth with $31 million in funding and how we\u2019re building the modern human risk platform\u2014that shapes behavior directly.\n\n[Read more](https://fablesecurity.com/transform-employees-to-first-line-of-defense/)\n\n![](https://fablesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/hr-meet-match-blog-1350-x-707-1024x529.png)\n\nSolution brief\n\n##### Human risk,   meet your match\n\nWe reimagined human risk management with the best of Al, and it's simply delightful.
